## ⚙️ Environment variables

You have to create a Spotify app. You can refer to the [official documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/) to create in a minute.

After created your app, you must first define the following environment variables:
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`
- `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can put them inside a `.env` file at the root of the project or by manually exporting them.

## 🧑‍💻 Get started

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
